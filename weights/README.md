# Weights

This folder contains model weights saved in PyTorch `.pt` format.

The model weights are the result of fine tuning the following four YOLOv8 models:
1.YOLOv8n
2.YOLOv8s
3.YOLOv8m
4.YOLOv8l

## Ways to use these weights include:

- Prediction with the YOLOv8 `classify.py` script.
- Prediction with a native PyTorch detection pipeline.
- Implement inside of an app.
- Use as checkpoints to fine-tune further models.
