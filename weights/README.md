# Weights

This folder contains model weights saved in PyTorch `.pt` format.

Two model weights files are provided and are the result of fine tuning the following four YOLOv8 models:

1.YOLOv8n
2.YOLOv8s

## Ways to use these weights include:

- Prediction with the YOLOv8 `classify.py` script.
- Prediction with a native PyTorch detection pipeline.
- Implement inside of an app.
- Use as checkpoints to fine-tune further models.
